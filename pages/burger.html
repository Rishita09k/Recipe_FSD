           <h2>Instructions</h2>
             
            <p>Make burger seasoning by combining all spices in a bowl. Set aside.
            Form Patties: Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns, since the meat will shrink as it cooks. (Don't over-handle the meat, or it will make it tough).
            Indent: Use your thumb to press a gentle indentation into the center of each patty, which will help them cook evenly and not puff up in the center. Cover and set aside while preheating grill. (Ice cube trick: Some chefs will put an ice cube on top of each indentation on the patties until they’re ready to cook, so they don't dry out.)
            Grill: Preheat grill to medium high heat. Just before cooking, sprinkle burger seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F.
            Add cheese on top of burger patties during the last minute of cooking. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving on a bun, with desired toppings.

            <h3>Notes</h3>
           <b>Meat:</b> Choose ground chuck over ground beef, if possible, or a combo of 60% ground chuck and 40% brisket. If using ground beef, make sure it’s at least 20% fat, or for lean ground beef, add some chopped bacon or a tablespoon of olive oil to the meat.
           <br> <b>Cheese:</b> American Cheese is traditional for hamburgers because it melts so well. Be sure to get it sliced fresh from the deli counter, and not “Kraft” singles “American cheese” squares. 
            To cook on the stove: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add enough oil to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Once hot, add the burger patties and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side, or until 160 degrees F.
            <br><b>Cooking Time:</b> 160 degrees F for medium doneness (about 3-4 minutes on each side), or a few minutes less for medium rare, or more for well done.
            Make Ahead Instructions:form burger patties and place parchment paper between patties, to separate them. Cover and store in fridge for 1-2 days, depending on freshness of the meat. 
            Freezing Instructions: Raw burger patties can be frozen for up to 3 months. Place parchment paper between patties and store in an airtight container. Thaw completely before grilling.
